Tired of your old DB2 databases ? Here's a new migration kit that will ship your data to PostgreSQL !

[Marc Cousin](https://github.com/marco44), one of my teamates at [Dalibo](http://www.dalibo.com/en/index) released
yesterday a new migration called [db2topg](https://github.com/dalibo/db2topg). As he's a bit too shy to present his own work, let me

**8 simple Steps**

1- Extract your database schema with `db2look`. This will generate a db2 SQL script

2- Launch ``db2topg.pl`` against the db2 SQL script. This will produce 3 Postgres SQL scripts:
  * before.sql contains orders that must be run before importing data
  * after.sql contains  orders that must be run after importing data
  * unsure.sql contains everything the could not be transformed automatically

3-  Run the `before.sql` script on PosgreSQL.

4- Extract the data from db2 with something like `/path/to/db2 -f export.db2`

5- Load the data into PostgreSQL with `deltocopy -d my_output_dir | psql -e --set=ON_ERROR_STOP=1 my_new_database`

6- Run the `after.sql` script on PosgreSQL

7- Run the `after.sql` script on PosgreSQL. Watch it fail and fix the statements taht could not be translated automatically.

8- Launch a `VACUUM ANALYZE` and enjoy your new PostgreSQL database :)

This is of course a basic tutorial. There's a bunch of options and parallel modes.
Please read the [README](https://github.com/dalibo/db2topg) file for more details.

Marc is already the author of [SQL Server to PostgreSQL Migration kit](http://dalibo.github.io/sqlserver2pgsql/) so he's now on a personal quest 
to liberate the DBA of the world from proprietary databases :)
