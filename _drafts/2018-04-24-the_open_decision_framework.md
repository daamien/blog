Tomorrow I'll talk about the [Open Decision Framework] at the [TEQNation conference] in The Netherlands and I'll try to explain how we can use open source principles to take better decisions.

Free Software is a powerful movement with many different types of 
governance models and a lot of diversity. But all the successful open source 
projects have one thing in common : over the years they have developped efficient 
decision worklfows to solve their problems. 

## Making decisions using open source principles

Dalibo is a small Postgres company but as we're growing, we face more complex issues 
and we want to maintain a governance model based on transparency and open thinking. 

Last year, we learned about a method call «[Open Decision Framework]» 
developped by [Red Hat]. We translated it in French and then we "forked" 
it to fit our organisation. 

So far this method has worked really well for us and it produced solutions 
to some big questions that were left unanswered for years. I've been so impressed 
by these results that I wanted to share our experience and show that 
open source principles can apply beyond writing code. 

If you want to learn more about it here's a shorter version of my talk recorded during [FOSDEM] in February :

PS: The video is a bit shaking and my english is rusty, but I hope the talk will 
make you want to learn more about the [Open Decision Framework] ! :)
