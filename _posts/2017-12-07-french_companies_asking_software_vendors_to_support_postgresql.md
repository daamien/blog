The French PostgreSQL Cross-Enterprise Work Group, a non-profit 
organization advocating 
for the adoption and use of PostgreSQL, just published an open letter to 
all software vendors that don’t already do so to take steps to 
support PostgreSQL as a database management system (DBMS). 
The ambition of this initiative is to incite them to adapt quickly 
to the irresistible IT transformation in progress in public and 
private companies.

Created in 2016, the PostgreSQL Cross-Enterprise Work Group ( called 
“Groupe de Travail Inter-Entreprise” or “GT Entreprise” in French) is a 
dedidacted 
task force inside the [PostgreSQLFr non-profit association](https://www.postgresql.fr/asso/). Over the last months,
it has grown remarkably.

In a new press release (link below) published yesterday, the workgroup sent an
open letter to software vendors, asking them officially to support PostgreSQL.

This is a major step for PostgreSQL in France and in the french-speaking 
countries. For the first time, more than 20 national and international 
companies
take an explicit stance in favor of PostgreSQL by recognizing the technical 
value of the software but also highlighting the benefits of 
the open source model itself.

Among these companies and public agencies, you can find : 
Air France,
Carrefour (retail), 
CASDEN (bank), 
CNES (national space study center), 
EDF, 
MSA / GIE AGORA (mutual insurance), 
E.Leclerc (retail), 
MAIF (mutual insurance), 
Météo France (national weather forecast agency), 
The National Education Ministry,
PeopleDoc,
SNCF (national railway company),
PeopleDoc, SNCF, 
Société Générale (bank)
and Tokheim Services Group.

These institutions gathered in the PostgreSQLFr association to share their experience, 
promote PostgreSQL and contribute to its development.  Beyond these 3 big missions, 
the remarkable point is that the group  organized itself by adopting the great 
principles of the PostgreSQL community: openess, mutual help, transparency, 
self-organization, etc.

To discover the activities of the group, you can come to the booth of the
PostgreSQL community during the Paris Open Summit 2017
or read the wiki page of the workgroup :

The enterprise workgroup is the very illustration of a fundamental principle
of open source: erasing the separation between software publishers and 
consumers. Within the PostgreSQL community, every user can become a contributor
and play a role in the development and promotion of the software.
