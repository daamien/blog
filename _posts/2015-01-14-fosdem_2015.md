FOSDEM is a unique free event that offers open source communities a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. The PostgreSQL Europe association organize an additional event called [FOSDEM PG Day](https://fosdem.org/2015/) the day before (Friday Jan. 30), which means you can enjoy 2 days entirely dedicated to PostgreSQL and its community. Yay !  

The schedule contains 2 talks from Dalibo's team : 

* Friday at 10h20 : Julien Rouhaud and Ronan Dunklau will present [Identifying missing indexes](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/fosdem2015/session/837-identifying-missing-indexes/) and the forthcoming version 2.0 of [POWA](http://dalibo.github.io/powa/) a dynamic workload analyzer for PostgreSQL. This new version will feature major improvements, especially a missing index detector and an advanced WHERE clause analyzer ( check the [pg_qualstats](https://github.com/dalibo/pg_qualstats) for more details), more filesystem I/O stats  (thanks to the [pg_stat_kcache](https://github.com/dalibo/pg_stat_kcache) extension) and a complete rewrite of the user interface.
 
  
* Saturday at 14h00 : Ronan will talk about [Foreign Data Wrappers in PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/fosdem2015/session/832-foreign-data-wrappers-in-postgresql-where-are-we-now/). Ronan is the creator of the [multicorn](http://multicorn.org/) project and wrote the [IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA](http://www.depesz.com/2014/07/14/waiting-for-9-5-implement-import-foreign-schema/) patch, he will present the latest improvements of the
various Foreign Data Wrapppers.


These 2 talks are part of rich and complete schedule. If you're a PostgreSQL user, come spend 2 days with us in Brussels !
