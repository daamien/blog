Join the conversation to build better GUI for Postgres !

<!--MORE-->

Last year, we organized a meeting in Warsaw, Poland to discuss and share 
experience on how to improve the PostgreSQL user experience. You can find 
details about this meeting on the PostgreSQL wiki page below:

<https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Graphic_Tools_Developper_Meeting_2017>

During the meeting, we talked about creating a dedicated communication channel 
for Developers and Graphic Designers inside the PostgreSQL  community to 
facilitate discussions, ideas, feedbacks and further meetings.

We've asked the Postgres admin team to open a dedicated mailing list and 
they kindly accepted to create a new list called :  pgsql-gui-dev@lists.postgresql.org

To join this list, please go to : <https://lists.postgresql.org/manage/>  to 
register and subscribe.

This mailing list is intended to be a place where developpers from various 
projects can talk about UI design, UX guidelines, User Research, API, common 
libaries, etc.  with the same principles that prevails in the Postgres 
community : diversity, openess, sharing,  respect and self-organization. Please 
also note that this new mailing list should NOT be used as a end-user support 
channel for a specific tool.

When you join the mailing list, please take a few minutes to present yourself 
and your projet and explain what you tool is for, who are your users, what 
problems you'd like to solve, etc.

See you there !
