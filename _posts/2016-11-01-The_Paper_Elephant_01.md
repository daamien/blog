The PostgreSQL Magazine project is back with an original concept named **The Paper Elephant** : 
a folded newspaper with a dynamic look & feel.

As always the content comes directly from the community ! In this first issue, we gathered articles 
from key members of the PostgreSQL project: Josh Berkus talks about the new version numbering scheme,  
Hans-Jürgen Schönig writes about performance and Craig Kierstens an overview of JSON, JSONB and hstore. 
You'll also find an interview of Paul Ramsey from the PostGIS project.

The Paper Elephant is an independent media edited by and for the PostgreSQL Community.
This issue was created with the financial help of [PostgreSQL Europe](https://www.postgresql.eu)
and many benevolent contributors ( witers, editors, reviewers ). Kudos to all of them. 

Just like the name says, The Paper Elephant is a "paper first" media: it is designed to be printed out 
and distributed during events (conferences, meetups, etc.) to promote PostgreSQL. 

The first edition will be available at [PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2016](https://2016.pgconf.eu), 
[Paris Open Source Summit 2016](http://www.opensourcesummit.paris/) and [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/). 
If you want to distribute the magazine at  a local IT event, please [Contact Us](mailto:contact@pgmag.org) !
