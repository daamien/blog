title: PostgreSQL Magazine needs you !
---

    <p>The first official issue of PostgreSQL Magazine is on its way !</p>


<p>If you want to help us, now is the time ! We need reviewers. Proof-reading takes only a few minutes and it's a
great way of contributing. It's an important job that gives the magazine its quality.</p>


<p>The review process based on a quite simple wiki. Each article is a wiki page. As a reviewer you just have to click "edit" and correct as many errors you can spot :-)</p>


<p>There are currently <a href="http://pgmag.org/wiki/01/reviewing">4 articles waiting for review</a> and few more to come by the end of the month.</p>


<p>If you're interested, please read the <a href="http://pgmag.org/wiki/reviewer_guidelines">reviewer guidelines</a> and subscribe to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/pgmag/">pgmag mailing list</a>.</p>


<p>We plan to release PostgreSQL Magazine #01 in April. And second issue is already scheduled for october 2012. Stay tuned !</p>
