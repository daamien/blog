We've just released a new version of [PoWA](http://dalibo.github.io/powa/), the PostgreSQL Workload Analyzer. Check out complete release note [here](http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1563/).


<!--MORE-->

This new version adds an highly requested feature : you can now collect stats from multiple PostgreSQL servers using a single PoWA instance. This should be usefull if you have many servers to monitor.
We've also improved the UI in many ways : the graph should be easier to read on full screen and the install process is more convienient

This version is probably the major release of the 1.x branch. We're currently working on the branch that will change almost everything :  PoWA 2.x will be only compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4 because we want to use the new stats and features of latest version. This should allow PoWA 2.x to some nice things like finding missing indexes or displaying advanced filesysteme stats. The 2.x version will also have a brand new user interface and we hope this will be similar to what we did when we rewrote completely the pgBadger interface 2 years ago...

Here's a some preview:

Of course we will continue to maintain PoWA 1.x for the users who installed it on PostgreSQL 9.3 servers
